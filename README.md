# Shotbow's ToggleSneak Mod

## About
### Motivation
Since Minecraft 1.15, 'Toggle' sneaking mode is a built-in option. However, this mod has benefits over the official toggle sneak:
- Supports Toggle and Hold modes simultaneously.
- Does not activate when flying or dismounting from entities; such as horses or when in spectator mode.
- Addition of Toggle Sprint.
- Optional display with the status of both sneak and sprint.

### Controls
By default, both sneak and sprint are enabled.
Sprinting is active when you move.
Sneaking (TOGGLE) can be active by pressing the sneak key once.
Sneaking (HOLD) can be active by holding the sneak key. When you let go, you will unsneak.

## FAQ
### Q: I can't/struggle to unsneak
A: You will need to turn Minecraft's sneak mode to 'Hold'. ToggleSneak does this for you when you enable it, you can use the keybinding (default: G) to quickly disable and then enable it. Or you can go into the client settings:
- Options
- Controls
- Change 'Sneak: Toggle' to 'Sneak: Hold'

### Q: I use an older and unsupported version of Minecraft
A: There are no plans to downgrade the usable versions of this mod. However, you can use <a href="https://github.com/BlueAnanas/ZebrasToggleSneak/">ZebrasToggleSneak</a> which is the predecessor of this mod.
